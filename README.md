# Research-Data-of-Server-Based-Speech-Recognition-System-with-Memory-Function
The research objective of this project is to explore
whether the speech recognition system can conduct memory cache
processing on the server side and propose a better processing
method. The project adopted python, developed for the base
script, at the same time with the local computer as the
hypothesis, write a common speech recognition system and
another called segment processing speech recognition system
code, and use large-scale data simulation technology for
analysis, obtained the two different cpu usage, finally under
the comparison named segment processing speech recognition
system code under the same conditions and ordinary speech
recognition system, can better memory cache and processing on
the server.
